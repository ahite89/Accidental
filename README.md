A music app for accidental inspiration

Allows the user to generate a random series of audible, notated pitches in real time

The user can alter multiple parameters to influence the result

Parameters include: Key, Scale, Pitch Range, Instrument, Note Durations, Steps Between Notes, Tempo, Volume, and more

Up to four separate voices can be utilized, each with their own parameters

Each voice can be downloaded as a separate MIDI file
